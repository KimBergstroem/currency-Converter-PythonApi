## **How to Use Travel Guide** üåé
The app will instantly display the converted amount based on current exchange rates. In addition to currency conversion, the app offers engaging travel-related questions to make your experience enjoyable. Explore destination recommendations and travel tips for your trip planning. Enjoy the convenience of currency conversion and the excitement of discovering new travel insights with the **travel_Guide** app.

---

## **Program Flow** üåé
The flowchart represents the logic of the <b>travel_Guide</b> application. The program starts by prompting the user to input their name and validates the input to ensure that the name is at least three letters long and contains only letters.

If the input is valid, a welcome message is shown briefly and then disappears. 
The terminal is cleared, and the program proceeds to display the main menu, offering four different options. Each option leads to a different path of choice by user:

1. <b>Country:</b>
This path prompts the user with different questions such as "Which content do you want to explore?" and "Which country are you interested in?". The user's inputs are processed using the Google Sheets API. If the inputs are valid string values, the information is saved and compared with existing data in the worksheet. This step ensures the correct currency is displayed for the selected country. The application provides the user with the accurate content, country, and currency information. Once all the necessary information is obtained, the user is prompted to either return to the main menu or perform another country search.

2. <b>Currency code:</b>
Choosing this path displays a library of all current currency codes automatically in the prompt. If the user is unfamiliar with the three-letter currency codes, they can select this option to view the codes. These codes are necessary for the currency exchange feature. After displaying the currency codes, the program automatically returns the user to the main menu.

3. <b>Currency Exchange:</b>
This path enables the user to input a currency and an amount to view the exchange rate. The currency exchange is facilitated by an API connected to the application, specifically the "Fixer API". This API provides daily updated rates between different currencies. The user is also presented with the result of the exchange, and if desired, they can choose to exchange another currency. Otherwise, the program asks whether the user wants to perform another currency exchange or return to the main menu.

4. <b>Exit:</b>
Finally, choosing option 4 displays the concluding message and exits the application. The terminal will be closed.

## **Data Model** üåé
The program uses the **Google Sheets API** to access a Google Sheet that contains content, country, and currency data. The program then saves and compares the placeholders for the user inputs and presents the resulting information. The program uses the `input()` function to get user choices and a series of validation functions to ensure that user inputs are valid.

The **Fixer API** is utilized in this application to provide access to real-time and historical exchange rate data for currency conversion purposes. It enables the integration of currency exchange functionality.

The application also imports **sys, time, os, requests, and gspread** modules to perform various tasks such as system interactions, time-related operations, HTTP requests, and Google Sheets integration.

### Automated Testing
The **PEP8** validator was used to validate all Python modules and files in this project. No errors were found.

The only file that gave an error was the `ascii_art.py` file. The warnings are some lines that are too long, which can't be undone or shortened, whitespaces, and an invalid escape sequence. This can't be fixed without breaking the ASCII style that is being used.

The error code is the following:

`W605 invalid escape sequence '\ '`

`E501 line too long (82 > 79 characters)`

### Manual Testing
Family and friends tested my app on their devices, and no issues were reported.

The scores below are the average results obtained from three users who attempted the following tests:

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Welcome message and user name validation | **`100%`** |
| Main menu option validation (selecting an invalid option) | **`100%`** |
| Currency conversion function (testing with different amounts) | **`100%`** |
| Currency exchange validation (selecting the wrong currency) | **`100%`** |
| Blank space validation for all inputs | **`100%`** |
| Validation of integer inputs for "Y" and "N" questions | **`100%`** |

&nbsp;

### **Solved Bugs**
| Type   | Bug | Solution |
|--------|-----|----------|
| run.py | The validation function was also accepting substrings of valid values, which led to unexpected behavior. For example, if the user was prompted to enter a continent and typed "asi", the code incorrectly considered this input as valid because "asi" is a substring of "Asia." This behavior was not desired as wanted and made the applicaiton to break further in the code when using the input data by user | I removed the line `key_value = user_content` as it was unnecessary. When user_content, originally a list, was assigned to a new variable (`key_value`), it became a string. Consequently, attempts to compare or search using in failed because `key_value` had become a string and not a list.  |
| run.py | Couldn't find countries in the worksheet that had blank spaces in their names, such as "Sri Lanka" or "New Zealand." This caused the application to display an error message stating that the country does not exist in the list, even though it actually does. | Used `.capitalize()` `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing spaces and also changed the worksheet entry from "Sri Lanka" to "Sri lanka" with only the first letter capitalized. |
| run.py | The application crashed when users attempted multiple searches for a country or currency due to the "Read requests per minute per user" limit on the Google Sheets API. This `gspread.APIError` occurred when the limit was exceeded. | Implemented a `try-except` block to handle the API error. When the error occurs, an appropriate message is displayed to the user, advising them to wait or return to the main menu and wait for 1 minute before making another request. |
| run.py | The application would crash when users entered invalid inputs such as blank spaces, integers, or string values where they were not expected. These inputs were not handled properly, resulting in a program crash. | Implemented stricter validation checks on the different input questions and displayed appropriate error messages when an invalid input was entered. |
| run.py | The currency conversion process was stuck in an endless loop, causing the program to hang indefinitely. | Identified that a while loop condition was missing an exit condition and added a break statement to terminate the loop once the conversion was complete. |

&nbsp;

### **Known Bugs**
| Type   | Bug | Possible Solution |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| run.py | Slow response time when accessing currency data | The program takes a long time to retrieve and display currency data, causing delays in the user experience. This could be due to slow network connections or inefficient data retrieval methods. |
